# Welcome to the netdata!

## Documentation

This wiki is the whole of it. Other than the wiki, currently there is the... source code.

I need help documenting everything. If you can help, please open a github issue stating you want to help. I'll be notified.

You should at least read the section **[[Why netdata?]]**. It has a good overview of the key benefits of installing netdata on your systems.

## Support

Please use the github issues section.

## FAQ

### Is it ready?

Software is never ready. Netdata is stable though. I use it on production systems without any issues.

### Is it released?

No it is not. It could be though. I need help to support a release.

### Can I code too?

Of course! Fork the repo, adapt as you see fit and create pull requests.

### Do you plan to implement a bigger / better database?

Yes, check the [[Memory Requirements]] page. I also plan to push all the data to dedicated time series databases like OpenTSDB, thus having netdata acting as a collector for them.
