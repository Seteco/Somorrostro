# Console tools... provide false information!

Yes, I know what you think. This cannot be happening.

Well... it does!

Let's see an example. Execute this in a shell:

```sh
while [ 1 ]; do ls -l /var/run >/dev/null; done
```

In most systems `/var/run` is a `tmpfs` device, so there is nothing that can stop this command from consuming entirely one of the CPU cores of the machine.

As we will see below, **none** of the console performance monitoring tools can report that this command is using 100% CPU. They do report of course that the CPU is busy, but **they fail to identify the process that consumes so much CPU**.

Here is what common Linux console monitoring tools report:

## top

`top` reports that `bash` is using just 14%.

If you check the total system CPU utilization, it says there is no idle CPU at all, but `top` fails to provide a breakdown of the CPU consumption in the system. The sum of the CPU utilization of all processes reported by `top`, is 15.6%.

## htop

Exactly like `top`, `htop` is providing an incomplete breakdown of the system CPU utilization.

## atop

`atop` is also suffering from the same syndrome.

## glances

And the same is true for `glances`. The system runs at 100%, but `glances` reports only 17% per process utilization.

Note also, that being a `python` program, `glances` uses 1.6% CPU while it runs.

## why this happens?

All the console tools report usage based on the processes found running *at the moment they examine the process tree*. So, they see just one `ls` command, which is actually very quick with minor CPU utilization. But the shell, is spawning hundreds of them, one after another (much like shell scripts do).

When I realized this fact, I got surprised! The Linux kernel **accounts at the parent process, the CPU time of processes that exit**. However, the calculation to properly report the CPU time on each process, including its children that have exited, is quite tricky, so all console tools preferred to just ignore it!

## what netdata reports?

The total CPU utilization of the system:

<br/>_**Figure 1**: The system overview section at netdata, just a few seconds after the command was run_

And now, the applications netdata believes are using all this CPU:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2662304/21076220/c9687848-bf2e-11e6-8d81-348592c5aca2.png)
<br/>_**Figure 2**: The Applications section at netdata, just a few seconds after the command was run_

So, my `ssh` session is using 95% CPU time.

Why `ssh`?

`apps.plugin` groups all processes based on its configuration file ([`/etc/netdata/apps_groups.conf`](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/blob/master/conf.d/apps_groups.conf)). The default configuration has nothing for `bash`, but it has for `sshd`, so netdata accumulates all ssh sessions to a dimension on the charts, called `ssh`. This includes all the processes in the process tree of `sshd`, **including the exited children**.

> Distributions based on `systemd`, provide another way to get cpu utilization per user session or service running: control groups, or cgroups, commonly used as part of containers. `apps.plugin` does not use these mechanisms. The process grouping made by `apps.plugin` works on any Linux, `systemd` based or not.
> Keep in mind **netdata** does detect containers and report resource utilization for each of them, but this is subject to another article...

## a more technical description of how netdata works

netdata reads `/proc/<pid>/stat` for all processes, once per second and extracts `utime` and `stime` (user and system cpu utilization), much like all the console tools do.

But it [also extracts `cutime` and `cstime`](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/blob/62596cc6b906b1564657510ca9135c08f6d4cdda/src/apps_plugin.c#L636-L642) that account the user and system time of the exited children of each process. By keeping a map in memory of the whole process tree, it is capable of assigning the right time to every process, taking into account all its exited children.

It is tricky, since a process may be running for 1 hour and once it exits, its parent should not receive the whole 1 hour of cpu time in just 1 second - you have to subtract the cpu time that has been reported for it prior to this iteration.

It is even trickier, because walking through the entire process tree takes some time itself. So, if you sum the CPU utilization of all processes, you might have more CPU time than the reported total cpu time of the system. netdata solves this, by adapting the per process cpu utilization to the total of the system. [Netdata adds charts that document this normalization](https://london.my-netdata.io/default.html#menu_netdata_submenu_apps_plugin).

## Conclusion

From a performance monitoring perspective, the lack of properly identifying the CPU consumption used by processes, is terrifying. All console tools I found, fail to properly report where the CPU goes.

In several cases, this leads to wrong conclusions. For example, I use several **pacemaker** clusters. Before netdata, I was not aware that the clustering software itself requires so much CPU.

pacemaker running on server A:

`top` reports only 2% for `lrmd`, while it consumes 35% on the average, with spikes even above 100% (100% = 1 core).

Similarly, pacemaker running on server B:
