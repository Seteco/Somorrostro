To view netdata collected data you access its **[[REST API v1]]**.

For our convenience, netdata provides 2 more layers:

1. The `dashboard.js` javascript library that allows us to design custom dashboards using plain HTML. For more information on creating custom dashboards, see **[[Custom Dashboards]]**.

2. Ready to be used web dashboards that render all the charts a netdata server maintains.
