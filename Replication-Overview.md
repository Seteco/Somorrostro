Each netdata is able to replicate/mirror its database to another netdata, by streaming collected metrics, in real-time to it. This is quite different to [data archiving to third party time-series databases](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki/netdata-backends).

When a netdata streams metrics to another netdata, the receiving one is able to perform everything a netdata performs:

- visualize them with a dashboard
- run health checks that trigger alarms and send alarm notifications
- archive metrics to a backend time-series database

The following configurations are supported:

## netdata without a database or web API (headless collector)
Local netdata (`slave`), **without any database or alarms**, collects metrics and sends them to another netdata (`master`).

The user can take the full functionality of the `slave` netdata at http://master.ip:19999/host/slave.hostname/. Alarms for the `slave` are served by the `master`.

In this mode the `slave` is just a plain data collector. It runs with... **5MB** of RAM (yes, you read correct), spawns all external plugins, but instead of maintaining a local database and accepting dashboard requests, it streams all metrics to the `master`.

The same `master` can collect data for any number of `slaves`.

---

## database replication
Local netdata (`slave`), **with a local database (and possibly alarms)**, collects metrics and sends them to another netdata (`master`).

The user can use all the functions **at both** http://slave.ip:19999/ and http://master.ip:19999/host/slave.hostname/.

The `slave` and the `master` may have different data retention policies for the same metrics.

Alarms for the `slave` are triggered by **both** the `slave` and the `master` (and actually each can have different alarms configurations or have alarms disabled).

---

## netdata proxies
Local netdata (`slave`), with or without a database, collects metrics and sends them to another netdata (`proxy`), which may or may not maintain a database, which forwards them to another netdata (`master`).

Alarms for the slave can be triggered by any of the involved hosts that maintains a database.

Any number of daisy chaining netdata servers are supported, each with or without a database and with or without alarms for the `slave` metrics.

---

## mix and match with backends

All nodes that maintain a database can also send their data to a backend database. This allows quite complex setups. Example:

1. netdata `A`, `B` do not maintain a database and stream metrics to netdata `C`(live streaming functionality, i.e. this PR)
2. netdata `C` maintains a database for `A`, `B`, `C` and archives all metrics to `graphite` with 10 second detail (backends functionality)
3. netdata `C` also streams data for `A`, `B`, `C` to netdata `D`, which also collects data from `E`, `F` and `G` from another DMZ (live streaming functionality, i.e. this PR)
4. netdata `D` is just a proxy, without a database, that streams all data to a remote site at netdata `H`
5. netdata `H` maintains a database for `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H` and sends all data to `opentsdb` with 5 seconds detail (backends functionality)
6. alarms are triggered by `H` for all hosts
7. users can use all the netdata that maintain a database to view metrics (i.e. at `H` all hosts can be viewed).

## netdata.conf configuration

These are options that affect the operation of netdata in this area:

```
[global]
    memory mode = none | ram | save | map
```

`[global].memory mode = none` disables the database at this host. This also disables health monitoring (there cannot be health monitoring without a database).

```
[web]
    mode = none | single-threaded | multi-threaded
```

`[web].mode = none` disables the API (netdata will not listen to any ports). This also disables the registry (there cannot be a registry without an API).

```
[backend]
    enabled = yes | no
    type = graphite | opentsdb
    destination = IP:PORT ...
    update every = 10
```

`[backend]` configures data archiving to a backend (it archives all databases maintained on this host).

---

## streaming configuration

A new file is introduced: `/etc/netdata/stream.conf`. This file holds streaming configuration for both the sending and the receiving netdata.

API keys are used to authorize the communication of a pair of sending-receiving netdata. Once the communication is authorized, the sending netdata can push metrics for any number of hosts.

You can generate an API key with the command `uuidgen`. API keys are just random GUIDs. You can use the same API key on all your netdata, or use a different API key for any pair of sending-receiving netdata.

### options for the sending node

This is the section for the sending netdata. On the receiving node, `[stream].enabled` can be `no`. If it is `yes`, the receiving node will also stream the metrics to another node (i.e. it will be a `proxy`).

```
[stream]
    enabled = yes | no
    destination = IP:PORT ...
    api key = XXXXXXXXXXX
```

---

This is an overview of how these options can be combined:

target | memory<br/>mode | web<br/>mode | stream<br/>enabled | backend | alarms | dashboard
-------|:-----------:|:---:|:------:|:-------:|:---------:|:----:
headless collector|`none`|`none`|`yes`|not possible|not possible|no
headless proxy|`none`|not `none`|`yes`|not possible|not possible|no
proxy with db|not `none`|not `none`|`yes`|possible|possible|yes
central netdata|not `none`|not `none`|`no`|possible|possible|yes

### options for the receiving node

`stream.conf` looks like this:

```
# replace API_KEY with your uuidgen generated GUID
[API_KEY]
    enabled = yes
    default history = 3600
    default memory mode = save
    health enabled by default = auto
```

You can add many such sections, one for each API key. The above are used as default values for all hosts pushed with this API key.

You can also add sections like this:

```
# replace MACHINE_GUID with the slave /var/lib/netdata/registry/netdata.public.unique.id
[MACHINE_GUID]
    enabled = yes
    history = 3600
    memory mode = save
    health enabled = yes
```

The above is the receiver configuration of a single host, at the receiver end. `MACHINE_GUID` is the unique id the netdata generating the metrics (i.e. the netdata that originally collects them `/var/lib/netdata/registry/netdata.unique.id`). So, metrics for netdata `A` that pass through any number of other netdata, will have the same `MACHINE_GUID`.

## tracing

When a `slave` is trying to push metrics to a `master` or `proxy`, it logs entries like these:

```

The receiving end (`proxy` or `master`) logs entries like these:

## Viewing remote host dashboards, using mirrored databases

On any receiving netdata, that maintains remote databases and has its web server enabled, `my-netdata` menu will include a list of the mirrored databases.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2662304/24080824/24cd2d3c-0caf-11e7-909d-a8dd1dbb95d7.png)

Selecting any of these, the server will offer a dashboard using the mirrored metrics.
