# So, your netdata is outdated?

We suggest to keep your netdata updated. We are actively developing it and you should always update to the latest version.

The update procedure depends on how you installed it:

## You downloaded it from github using git

If you installed netdata by downloading from github and running our `netdata-installer.sh`, you can just install it again, over the old installation. Your configuration will not be touched.

Just follow the **[[Installation]]** instructions again and your are done!

Keep in mind though, netdata may now have new features, or certain old features may now behave differently. So pay some attention to it after updating.

## You downloaded a binary package

If you installed it from a binary package, the best way is to **obtain a newer copy** from the source you got it in the first place.

If a newer version of netdata is not available from the source you got it, we suggest to uninstall the version you have and follow the **[[Installation]]** instructions for installing a fresh version of netdata.
