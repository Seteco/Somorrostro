# So, your netdata is outdated?

We suggest to keep your netdata updated. We are actively developing and you should always update to the latest version.

The update procedure depends on how you installed it.

## How have installed from github

If you installed netdata by downloading from github and running our installer, you can just install it again, over the old installation.

Just follow the **[[Installation]]** instructions again and your are done!

## You have installed it using a binary package

If you installed it from a binary package, the best way is to **obtain a newer copy** from the source you got it in the first place.

If a newer version of netdata is not available from the source you got it, we suggest to uninstall the version you have and follow the **[[Installation]]** page for installing a fresh version of netdata.
