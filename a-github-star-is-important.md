GitHub stars allow netdata to expand its reach, to attract people with skills.

netdata needs people with skills. Compared to the time it was first released, netdata is now twice as fast, has all its bugs settled and a lot more functionality. This happened mainly because of the stars it received.

Stars also motivate us. They state that you find our work useful.

So, we need your help to make netdata better.

Give netdata a star, at the top right of this page.

Thank you!
