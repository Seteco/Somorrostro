**GitHub stars** allow netdata to expand its reach, to attract people to use it and especially people with skills willing to contribute. Compared to its first release, netdata is now twice as fast, has all its bugs settled and a lot more functionality. This happened because a lot of people find it useful, use it and contribute to it.

**GitHub stars** also motivate us. They state that you find our work **useful**. They give us strength to continue developing it and make it better.

So, give netdata a **GitHub star**, at the top right of this page.

Thank you!
