# What is the `my-netdata` menu item?

It lists the netdata servers you have visited.


## Why?

netdata provides distributed monitoring.

Traditionally, monitoring solutions centralize all the data to provide unified dashboards across all servers. This has a few cons:

1. due to the resources required, the number of metrics collected is very low.
2. for the same reason, the data collection frequency is not that frequent, at best it will be once every 10 or 15 seconds, at worst every 5 or 10 mins.
2. the central monitoring solution can only *scale up*, thus becoming "another bottleneck" in the whole ecosystem. It also requires maintenance, administration, etc.
3. due to all the above, most centralized monitoring solutions are usually good for presenting *statistics of past performance* (i.e. cannot be used for performance troubleshooting).

Netdata has a different approach:

1. data collection happens per second
2. thousands of metrics per server are collected
3. data do not leave the server
4. netdata servers do not talk to each other
5. your browser connects all the netdata servers

Using netdata, your monitoring infrastructure is embedded on each server, limiting significantly the need of additional resources. netdata is very resource efficient and utilizes server resources that already exist and are spare (on each server). This allows **scaling out** the monitoring infrastructure. 

However, the netdata approach introduces a few new issues that need to be addressed, one being **the list of netdata we have installed**, i.e. the URLs our netdata servers are listening.

To solve this, netdata utilizes a **central registry**.

## What is the registry?

The registry is a very lightweight operation (netdata can serve 50.000 registry queries per second per core, on celeron processors).

The registry keeps track of 3 entities:

1. **machines**: i.e. the netdata installations (a random GUID generated by each netdata the first time it starts; we call this **machine_guid**)

  For each netdata installation (each `machine_guid`) the registry keeps track of the different URLs it is accessed.

2. **persons**: i.e. the web browsers accessing the netdata installations (a random GUID generated by the registry the first time it sees a new web browser; we call this **person_guid**)

  For each person, the registry keeps track of the netdata installations it has accessed and their URLs.

3. **URLs** of netdata installations (as seen by the web browsers)

  For each URL, the registry keeps the URL and nothing more. Each URL is just linked to *persons* and *machines*. The only way to find a URL is to know its **machine_guid** and have a **person_guid** it is linked to it.

## Who talks to the registry?

Your web browser **only**!

Your netdata servers do not talk to the registry. This is a UML diagram of its operation:

```sequence
web browser->netdata: give me 'dashboard.js'
netdata-->web browser: here it is
web browser->netdata: give me registry info
netdata-->web browser:  here it is
web browser->registry: Hey registry, I am accessing this netdata
registry-->web browser: nice!, here are other netdata servers you have accessed in the past
```


## What data the registry maintains?

Its database contains:

- **random person GUIDs**,
- **random machine GUIDs**
- **URLs**.

For persons and machines, it keeps links to URLs with 2 timestamps (first time seen, last time seen) and a counter (number of times it has been seen).

## Which is the default registry?

`registry.my-netdata.io` which is currently served by http://london.my-netdata.io

#### Can this registry handle the global load of netdata installations?

Yeap! The registry can get 50.000 - 100.000 requests **per second per core** (depending on the type of CPU, the computer's memory bandwidth, etc). 50.000 is on J1900 (celeron 2Ghz).

We believe, it can do it...

## Every netdata can be a registry

Yes, you read correct, **every netdata can be a registry**. Just pick one and configure it.
