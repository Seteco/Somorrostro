# SNMP Data Collector

Using this collector, netdata can collect data from any SNMP device.

Any number of SNMP devices, with any number of charts having any number of dimensions can be defined. Each device may also have a different update frequency.

The source code of the plugin is [here](https://github.com/firehol/netdata/blob/master/node.d/snmp.node.js).
